        description: `Although biotechnology is a relatively young field, it will likely be the next revolution following the infotech revolution of the 20th century.
         Hence we at IGEM IIT Madras decided to embark upon the Language Project to simplify the various jargon and the basic concepts involved in Synthetic Biology, Genetic and Biotechnology as a whole.
        In India, as in other parts of the world, the public does not have a clear purview of the research and findings in biotechnology, so much so that basic know-how of genetics is also not common and the brunt of the decisions in the public domain like that of GMO, gene editing falls into the hands of lobbyists. 
        To address this issue we've made content about the basics of biotechnology in a commoner's language. The content is made available in 15 Indian and 20 foreign languages.
        We had worked with several students from our institution and also with other iGEM teams.  `,

Typically we expose students to various cool and crazy ideas, that have been a part iGEM projects and design games with biobricks. Conducting programs in schools have been an integral part of the human practices for the iGEM teams.
        We think we might have inspired a few fellas to take up Genetic Engineering in the long run.`,
