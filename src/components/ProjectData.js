        description: 'In 2008, a group of like-minded individuals came together to lay the foundation of the IGEM team at IIT Madras. Their aim was to design and validate a library of sigma-dependent promoters for Escherichia coli. They developed the stRessKit which was a BioBrick library of Lac-repressed σ24, σ28, σ32 and σ38 promoters for E.Coli. The following design specifications were taken into consideration while working on this project: the designed promoters must conform to the BioBrick standards, express modularity and must be LacI repressed but σ dependent.',

Their goal was to design a novel versatile system that is able to maintain any proposed plasmid into E.coli by utilizing consumer-defined selection pressure. Based on this conjecture, a custom plasmid retaining system can be designed and co-transformed along with the plasmid of interest which will maintain this plasmid. Working in collaboration with each other, they designed genetic circuits in cells aiming to direct plasmid loss in a regulated fashion.",

        description: "In 2021, we at team GEnoM, IIT Madras embarked on a unique journey, coming together virtually to design a bacterial cellulose-based insulin patch, SYNSULIN. Our project aims to utilize whey, a wastewater effluent to produce bacterial nanocellulose. This biomaterial finds application in various industries owing to its extraordinary properties: biocompatibility, high mechanical strength, biodegradability, nil toxicity, high crystallinity, chemical and morphological controllability. Some of the potential industries we explored whilst we were creating this project are Nanofibrillated Bacterial Cellulose when used in  packaging of food materials can enhance their preservation along with antimicrobial properties Used in beverages, adding value to the product Owing to their antimicrobial properties, they are increasingly used in cosmetics. Also find applications in textiles with high tensile strength and hydrophobicity The team specifically focussed on developing insulin patches with bacterial cellulose. These biocompatible skin patches are non-invasive, biodegradable and have controlled drug release, thus having an edge over conventional tools for drug delivery like syringes and infusers. Whey water is the proposed feedstock for the production of bacterial cellulose. Given that 50% of the whey water produced is disposed unutilised, our project also reduces environmental pollution. Our chassis for producing Bacterial nanocellulose is Komagataeibacter xylinus. Since, this acetic acid bacteria cannot utilise the lactose present in whey directly, our team modelled a co-culture by engineering two different mutant strains of K. xylinus to optimize the process.These strains include: Engineering K. xylinus gal(-) strain with lacZ gene  Engineering K.xylinus gal(+) strain with uridyltransferase and galactokinase to metabolise galactose Having received satisfactory results during our initial analysis, we wish to take this forward by enhancing the designs and performing wet lab experiments as well.",
